"""Atomic JSON file writes.

Use this everywhere a JSON config file is persisted. A plain `open("w") +
json.dump` truncates the file on first write and only fills it with new
content afterwards — a kill -9 / power loss / OOM in between produces a
truncated or empty file. For password DBs (`auth.json`) and live state
(`sessions.json`, `settings.json`, `integrations.json`, `cookbook_state.json`),
that's a data-loss event.

`atomic_write_json` writes to a sibling tmp file, fsyncs, then `os.replace`s
into place. On POSIX `os.replace` is atomic on the same filesystem.
