# Testing And Devops

Last updated: dev@e71f8ce | 2026-08-25

## Scope

This spec covers development and validation surfaces in:

- `tests/`, `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/*.mjs`, and `tests/bombadil-spec.ts`;
- `tests/run_focus.py`, `tests/run_order_report.py`, `tests/_taxonomy.py`, `tests/TESTING_STANDARD.md`, and `tests/LAYOUT_INVENTORY.md`;
- `pyproject.toml`;
- `requirements.txt` and `requirements-optional.txt`;
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`;
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker/gpu.nvidia.yml`, `docker/gpu.amd.yml`, `docker/host-docker.yml`, top-level standalone GPU compose files, and `docker/entrypoint.sh`;
- `scripts/`, `scripts/geplex`, `scripts/_lib/cli.py`, `scripts/_completion/*`, `scripts/pr_blocker_audit.py`, and `scripts/geplex-*`;
- GPU helper scripts `scripts/check-docker-gpu.sh` and `scripts/check-docker-amd-gpu.sh`;
- `.github/` templates, workflows, and description-check scripts;
- contributor workflow docs in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/pr-blocker-audit.md`;
- platform launchers `launch-windows.ps1`, `launcher.py`, `GepLex.spec`, `build-windows-portable.ps1`, `start-macos.sh`, `build-macos-app.sh`, and `update_windows.bat`;
- setup/service files such as `setup.py`, `install-service.sh`, and `geplex-ui.service`.

## Test Runtime

Pytest is configured in `pyproject.toml` with:

- `testpaths = ["tests"]`;
- `asyncio_mode = "auto"`;
- marker and fast-lane/duration-reporting settings used by focused test runs.

The expected local command uses the project venv:

```bash
./venv/bin/pytest <test path>
```

Activated-venv `python -m pytest <test path>` is equivalent. System/global `pytest` is not authoritative for this repo because installed versus stubbed dependencies can change collection behavior.

`tests/conftest.py` inserts the repo root on `sys.path` and conditionally stubs missing heavy/runtime dependencies such as SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, Starlette, Pydantic, httpx, bcrypt, and pyotp. Tests that need real dependencies use explicit imports/skips. Tests that stub `sys.modules`, environment variables, globals, or parent packages must restore them with `monkeypatch` or an equivalent cleanup pattern.

The suite currently contains roughly 728 `test_*.py` files. Treat that count as a moving source metric, not a target; focused regression tests are still preferred for narrow changes.

Focused regression tests are preferred for narrow behavior changes. Broaden tests when touching shared contracts such as auth, owner filtering, OAuth/token custody, tool output, context building, provider calls, persistence, frontend rendering, or route/API shapes.

`tests/run_focus.py` and `tests/_taxonomy.py` provide a local focused-run helper and category map. `.github/scripts/focused_test_guidance.py` maps changed files to suggested focused tests for PR review, while the configured full pytest CI job is authoritative. `tests/TESTING_STANDARD.md` documents expectations for targeted validation, and `tests/LAYOUT_INVENTORY.md` records the test-suite layout. CLI tests live under `tests/cli/`.

## JS And UI Tests

The repo has no frontend build pipeline, npm test script, or type-check script. `package.json` owns Node dependencies for Bombadil and the Anthropic SDK, and `package-lock.json` owns npm integrity/version state.

Current frontend/JS validation includes:

- pytest wrappers that run Node snippets and usually skip when `node` is missing;
- direct `.mjs` regressions under `tests/`;
- `tests/bombadil-spec.ts`, which requires npm-installed Bombadil dev dependencies and a running/browser-capable UI workflow when used.

Use `node --check static/js/<changed-file>.js` for syntax checks on changed JS files when applicable. This is not a full module-graph, browser-global, or DOM integration check.

## Dependencies

`requirements.txt` owns core runtime and test dependencies, including pytest, pytest-asyncio, MCP, Chroma HTTP client, fastembed, qrcode, and core parsing/search/calendar dependencies.

`requirements-optional.txt` owns optional feature dependencies:

- `faster-whisper` for local STT;
- `kokoro==0.9.4` and `soundfile` for local TTS on Python 3.11-3.12 only; Kokoro is deliberately skipped on Python 3.13+ because its package metadata excludes those runtimes, and a CUDA-capable torch/GPU is still required at runtime;
- `ddgs` for DDG library support, while provider code can fall back to HTML scraping;
- `PyMuPDF` for PDF forms/rendering with AGPL implications for a network-served app;
- `markitdown[docx,pptx,xlsx,xls]` for Office/EPUB extraction, pinned to a release older than 30 days.

Optional dependencies should produce clear degraded behavior when absent unless intentionally promoted to core. MarkItDown and PyMuPDF already have focused degraded-path coverage; local STT missing-`faster-whisper` behavior is a remaining coverage gap. Core runtime requirements include `httpx2` where compatibility tests depend on it. The official Docker image additionally installs `libmagic1` plus `python-magic==0.4.27` for content-based upload MIME sniffing; that pairing is image-owned because `python-magic` needs the system shared library at import time.

Chroma has two compatibility modes:

- Docker uses a separate `chromadb` service and core `chromadb-client`/`fastembed`;
- native macOS setup removes conflicting `chromadb-client` and installs full `chromadb`.

Vector features should fail fast or degrade to unhealthy/keyword fallback when the service is unavailable.

## Docker Runtime

Docker Compose is the primary deployment path:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=120 geplex
```

`docker-compose.yml` starts GepLex, ChromaDB, SearXNG, and ntfy. It binds services to loopback by default through `APP_BIND`, `CHROMADB_BIND`, and `NTFY_BIND`, persists configurable `APP_DATA_DIR`/`APP_LOGS_DIR`, SSH identity, HuggingFace cache, and user-local Python installs, and gives the GepLex container host-loopback reachability through `host.docker.internal`.

Compose variants forward `GEPLEX_TTS_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`, defaulting in the service to 500 MiB, and run the mounted `scripts/migrate_searxng_settings.py` helper so retained SearXNG YAML gains default inheritance without replacement. The helper preserves file metadata and formatting where possible and writes atomically; migration failure is non-fatal to the wrapper command. MCP OAuth callback setup follows `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL`, `APP_PUBLIC_URL`, or the launcher/bind `APP_PORT`, so externally remapped deployments should set a public base explicitly.

`Dockerfile` builds a Python 3.14 slim image with Node/npm, tmux, OpenSSH client, git/cmake, the pinned Docker CLI `29.6.2`, `gosu`, `libmagic1`, and the image-only `python-magic` wrapper.

`docker/entrypoint.sh` owns writable path ownership repair, PUID/PGID user/group creation and privilege drop, optional host-Docker socket group handling, vLLM/CUDA environment defaults, idempotent `setup.py`, and final uvicorn execution.

Docker does not mount the host Docker socket by default. Mounting it would grant powerful host access and is outside the default trust boundary. `docker/host-docker.yml` is the explicit opt-in overlay and sets `GEPLEX_ENABLE_HOST_DOCKER=true`; tests guard that the default and GPU compose files do not enable host Docker accidentally.

## GPU And Platform

Base `docker-compose.yml` plus `docker/gpu.nvidia.yml` or `docker/gpu.amd.yml` are the GPU source of truth. Top-level `docker-compose.gpu-nvidia.yml` and `docker-compose.gpu-amd.yml` are standalone mirrors for stack-management UIs that accept one compose file. `tests/test_gpu_compose_standalone.py` guards drift between those forms.

GPU overlays pass host devices/runtime flags only. They do not install CUDA/ROCm userspace or serving engines; those are installed later through Cookbook/dependency flows.

NVIDIA helper behavior:

- `scripts/check-docker-gpu.sh` diagnoses passthrough;
- it is read-only by default;
- toolkit install and `.env` edits require explicit user flags and successful passthrough checks.

AMD helper behavior:

- `scripts/check-docker-amd-gpu.sh` is read-only;
- it prints expected `COMPOSE_FILE`/`RENDER_GID` values and verifies `/dev/kfd`/`/dev/dri` visibility.

Native platform launchers:

- `launch-windows.ps1` requires Python 3.11+, creates `venv`, installs `requirements.txt`, runs `setup.py`, discovers per-user Git Bash installs where possible, warns when Git Bash is missing, and starts uvicorn on port 7000 by default.
- `launcher.py`, `GepLex.spec`, and `build-windows-portable.ps1` own the PyInstaller-style portable Windows launcher path, including app-root/data-dir differences covered by `src.runtime_paths`.
- `start-macos.sh` reads `.env`, defaults to port 7860 to avoid AirPlay conflicts, prefers Homebrew arm64 Python, installs/tolerates Homebrew Cookbook deps, handles Chroma package conflicts, starts ChromaDB for native runs, runs `setup.py`, and starts uvicorn.
- `build-macos-app.sh` builds a launcher app around the existing repo venv and logs to `logs/geplex-app.log`.
- `update_windows.bat` owns the tested Windows Docker update flow.

## Scripts And CLI

`scripts/geplex` is the umbrella dispatcher for executable `scripts/geplex-*` commands. It discovers subcommands and executes them through the project venv Python when available.

`scripts/_lib/cli.py` owns shared CLI behavior:

- repo-root importability;
- quiet logging;
- JSON output and `--pretty`;
- `--version`;
- common parser scaffolding;
- exit handling.

`LOG_LEVEL` is the shared process logging toggle. CLI helpers default it to
`WARNING` to keep JSON command output clean; the web app defaults it to `INFO`
and applies it to root, console, rotating-file, and direct-uvicorn logging.
Shell completions in `scripts/_completion/` introspect CLI `--help` output through the venv and cache subcommands.

`scripts/geplex-*` provide local CLI surfaces for backup, calendar, contacts, Cookbook, docs, gallery, logs, mail, MCP, memory, notes, personal docs, presets, research, sessions, signatures, skills, tasks, theme, and webhooks.

When route/API behavior changes, check whether a matching CLI script depends on the old shape. There is no central CLI scrubber: each credential/log/mail/task/backup/MCP/webhook script owns its own sensitive-output behavior.

## GitHub Metadata

`.github/` owns issue/PR templates, a copyable PR review template, description-check workflows, security/governance workflows, Docker publishing, and CI. Current CI runs on pushes to `main` and `dev` plus pull requests, compiles Python with `python -m compileall`, syntax-checks first-party JS with `node --check`, emits focused-test guidance for changed code, and runs the configured `python -m pytest -q` scope as an authoritative failing job; pytest still skips documentation-only changes.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` owns the branch model: PRs target `dev`; `main` is the curated user-running branch fast-forwarded from stable `dev` commits. Contributors who accidentally target `main` should retarget the PR base without rebasing.

PR description checks:

- run on `pull_request_target`;
- check out only base-branch `.github/scripts`;
- skip bot PRs;
- require Summary, Linked Issue, Type of Change, duplicate-search checklist, and substantive How to Test content as the hard description gate;
- classify changed paths as docs-only, tooling, backend/runtime, or UI-sensitive from GitHub's file API while executing only base-branch checker code;
- treat app-run and screenshot/clip checkboxes as author attestations, require an actual media link/attachment for UI-sensitive changes, and report runtime/visual evidence gaps separately from malformed descriptions;
- serialize mergeability labeling behind description validation and avoid granting `ready for review` to drafts or changes with outstanding runtime/visual evidence;
- update a bot comment and reconcile `ready for review`, `needs work`, `needs runtime validation`, and `needs visual evidence` labels where those labels exist.

Issue description checks:

- validate bug or feature sections based on labels;
- require bug reports to include the exact 12-character revision/date shape produced by `git show -s --abbrev=12 --format='%h (%cs)' HEAD`;
- flag unfilled dropdown placeholders such as `-- Please Select --`;
- route public vulnerability reports toward GitHub Security Advisories;
- update a bot comment and swap status labels;
- remove the workflow-owned review label when an issue closes so closed issues do not retain stale readiness state.

Security metadata includes container Trivy SARIF upload, Dockerfile lint, dependency review, secret scan, workflow security linting, GitHub default-setup CodeQL, Dependabot metadata, and hardened PR/issue description checks that avoid unsafe head-branch execution. `docs/security-ci.md` documents CodeQL as a dynamic GitHub default-setup workflow; the repo should not add a checked-in CodeQL workflow while that default setup is active.

`scripts/pr_blocker_audit.py` is a read-only maintainer/contributor triage helper documented in `docs/pr-blocker-audit.md`. It can fetch or ingest open PR metadata, estimate hot files and possible duplicate groups, and emit Markdown, JSON, or terminal reports. Its duplicate/blocker output is advisory, not an authority that a PR is blocked.

Before posting PRs or issues, compare drafts against current templates on latest `main` or current `dev` as appropriate for the target. Keep unpublished drafts and raw related-search exports out of tracked implementation specs unless intentionally promoted.

## Artifacts And Secrets

- Do not read `.env*` files unless a user explicitly asks for a controlled setup/debug step; never print their values.
- Backup files, logs, CLI JSON, and raw issue/PR search exports can contain sensitive local data.
- Do not commit raw GitHub JSON unless there is an explicit maintainer reason. Prefer compact Markdown reports when publishing analysis.
- Specs are implementation truth. Planning, research, branch notes, and draft reports belong in tracked project docs when promoted.

## Development Checks

Common local checks:

```bash
./venv/bin/pytest tests/path.py::test_name
./venv/bin/python -m py_compile app.py routes/*.py src/*.py
node --check static/js/changed-file.js
docker compose config
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs --tail=120 geplex
```

Run the app for user-facing or integration changes. Unit tests and syntax checks do not replace end-to-end verification for UI, Docker, provider, auth, or routing behavior.

## Shared Test Helpers

`tests/helpers/` owns reusable test scaffolding. `cli_loader.load_script()` loads CLI files without running their `main()` entrypoint. `db_stubs` owns small DB stand-ins for tests that should not import a real app database. `import_state` owns conservative `sys.modules` and parent-module-attribute restoration for tests that install fake modules or import route files under alternate stubs. `tests/README.md` documents helper conventions and review expectations.

## Current Gaps

- Fresh install smoke coverage across Linux native, Docker, macOS native/app, Windows native, WSL/Git Bash, missing Node/npm, missing Chroma service, and GPU overlays remains a roadmap item.
- There is no frontend build/type-check/npm test pipeline.
- CI now covers Python compile, first-party JS syntax, focused-test guidance,
  and pytest smoke; it does not cover Docker compose validation, launcher smoke
  tests, browser/module-graph execution, or platform installs.
- Optional dependency behavior is broad; remaining gaps include local STT missing-`faster-whisper`, Kokoro's Python/GPU degraded matrix, and provider/OAuth combinations not covered by focused tests.
- GitHub description-check scripts and `scripts/pr_blocker_audit.py` need continued local fixtures for section parsing, placeholder stripping, label swaps, workflow-safe behavior, and duplicate/hot-file heuristics.
- Spec bootstrap rules lack meta tests for reading `_readme.md`, spec shape, `.env*` handling, draft/report placement, and shared helper conventions.
- NVIDIA helper install/`.env` mutation paths and real Docker/GPU startup are not covered by local tests.
- Bash/Zsh completion behavior is not covered.
- There is no canonical full-suite known-failing/flaky ledger.
- There is no central CLI redaction/sensitive-output regression matrix across backup, logs, mail, MCP, tasks, and webhook scripts.
- Dependency/image pinning policy is mixed: Python requirements are mostly unpinned, SearXNG is pinned, Chroma image currently uses `latest`, npm uses a lockfile, and browser MCP uses cache-gated `@playwright/mcp@latest`.
